Ever since I was young I have been into computers. According to my mother, I used my first computer when I was 4. I am hardly ever without one of my computers, or without a way to access said computers. Growing up I was the technical guru, all my close family called to me or their computer, phone and television needs. I never really minded helping my family, just always seemed like the right thing to do. By no means do I consider myself an expert, I still ask questions and research things multiple times a day. I took a class once in high school which taught me the basics of my web programming knowledge. But now I am learning even more complex programming languages and putting these new found skills to work.
