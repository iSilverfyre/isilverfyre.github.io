Incredibles 2 released in US theaters on June 15, 2018, almost 13 years after the original was released.  I remember watching the first and loving the movie. And the sequel was just as great, even leaving room for a third movie.  Then again that might be another 10 years from now.  Overall, a cute family movie followed the characters from the original and provided a nice villain.
