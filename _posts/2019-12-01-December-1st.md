It's now the last month of the year, so why not try to get some blogging in and keep a record of some of the things that happen this month.  Shoot I should have kept some logs from the summer but a little late now.  Who knew that the year 2019 was going to fly by so fast and here we are at the last 30 days.  Or maybe it wasn't as fast for you, who knows, that might be because I was searching for a job part way though the year (things I should have written about in the summer). But regardless the time is here and now and it is almost done.

Fire drills should never be held at 6 AM, although who knows maybe their was a fire.  All I know is 6:45 AM is way to early to be woken up by fire alarms.  The fire alarm for the complex behind us was going off this morning and woke me up.  About 5 minutes later I hear the sirens and presume they took care of what was needed.  I had gotten up too see where the noise was coming from but once I has identified it wasn't my building on fire and I was in no immediate thread and got back in bed.

Today I was able to go get the Christmas Tree I had promised to get my roommate.  I wanted to do it sooner, like middle of November sooner, but saldy both of our lives got in the way.  But the tree is bought and being put up, I even managed a few decorative lights for the house.  As well decorations for the office were purchased, because why not, we are having a contest and I like shiny things.  By this weekend I will have more Christmas then I (and possibly my co-workers) know what to do with.  But that is for later this week.

My roommate finished the tree and sent me a picture and well it looks beautiful I must say.  I will attach a picture at the end of said tree for those who like that stuff.  And I guess this is starting to sound kind of rambley so maybe I should stop here.  Happy December 1st everyone, and tune in next time for my next crazy update, hopefully not months from now.
