So you know how I said how our building at work was evacuated yesterday? Well, I work in a 13 story building (Plaza Level plus 12 floors) and I work on the 9th floor.  So when fire alarms go off as you were always taught you donâ€™t use elevators but the stairs.  And well I am not in any form of shape except maybe a roundish one. And I will tell you my thighs and calf muscles were screaming this morning when I woke up from going down 10 flights of stairs.  One might think, well at least your alive you could have died in a fire.  This would be well and good if there had indeed been a fire.  No, the alarm was triggered by a crew spray painting in the garage triggering the fire alarm. All I can hope is that I am not in nearly as much pain tomorrow.
