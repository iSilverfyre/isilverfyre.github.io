I’ve been in the process of constructing this website and well frankly I am not even 100% sure what it will become. I have changed my mind a few hundred times on what I will and will not have in it. But regardless it will be mine and I will make the best of it.

As for this blog area well this is undecided as well. I have never been great at blogging but have always wanted to get into it myself. So nodes my chance to see what I come up with. And let’s kick it off with something fun. I started my day off forgetting that I do work and woke up about a half hour before work started with a 45-minute drive minimum. And 2 hours into work fire alarm on the first floor demanded the evacuation of the building. First time for me to experience a fire alarm in corporate America and not nearly as bad as it could have been.

Well, this is what I have for now. If there is anything else eventful today I will update accordingly.
