So I am thinking about redoing this website (not just the blog) again.  Or well more specifically I am bringing it back to Wordress.  This site was initially an HTML single page website, which I grew into a WordPress based site. Eventually broke it back down into HTML as I wanted to practice writing HTML.  With that out of the way, or mostly learned to the hard code what I want, I think it is time to go back to WordPress.

I had more options and more control with wordpress so there is that.  I will still continue to build my random projects in hard coded sites, those will be located at https://files.silverfyre.info which has a plethora of work to begin with.  So sit back and relax and enjoy the suble changes of my website over the next few days and weeks.
